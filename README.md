Excited to share that I recently had the opportunity to develop an E-commerce Sales Dashboard.
In this project, I 📊 Identified key performance indicators to track business performance.
 🌍 Visualized the top 5 countries and top 3 states by sales.
 🛒 Segmented sales data by Category, Market, and Ship Mode.
This hands-on experience helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization, analytics, and turning data into insights that matter.
